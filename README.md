# [Sample plug-in: Table Numbering Plug-in]
## Purpose of the Sample Plug-in
This sample plug-in is available for educational purposes.  
Use this plug-in to understand how Kintone plug-ins work, and how they are structured.

## What the plug-in does
This sample plug-in automatically adds row numbers to table rows each time the record is saved. The numbers are inserted into a number field in the table and automatically re-number themselves when the record is edited and re-saved.
